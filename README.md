# Style Fixer!

Style Fixer is an extension that fixes small details like an off-center icon or a button with a different background than its siblings.

In particular circumstances, also try to create a new view on a website without responsive view in a specific size.

# Responsive

- **WhatsApp** 
	- 480px - 640px
		- Chat list doesn't show the name, only the image and the number of unread messages.
		- Side menus now span the entire screen.
		- The menu is now at the top, the search bar too.

# Fixes

	- Removed the background of the voice search button at **<656px view**.
	- 
- **Instagram**
	- Centered *(visually)* the message icon in the side navbar.
